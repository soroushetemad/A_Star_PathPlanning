# A* Path Planning for TurtleBot3 Waffle

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing the A* (A-star) algorithm for path planning on a TurtleBot3 Waffle robot navigating through a predefined obstacle space. The A* algorithm is a widely used method for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph, making it suitable for navigation tasks.

## Dependencies
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- TurtleBot3 packages
- Gazebo (optional, for simulation)
- RViz (optional, for visualization)
- Python (for implementing the A* algorithm)

## Installation
1. Install ROS following the instructions provided on the official ROS website.
2. Install the TurtleBot3 packages by following the instructions on the official TurtleBot3 GitHub repository.
3. Install Gazebo and RViz if you intend to use simulation and visualization tools.
4. Ensure Python is installed on your system.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository into your ROS workspace.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
